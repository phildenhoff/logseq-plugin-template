## Technical choices

### Why Svelte?

It's a pretty-good framework. Feel free to adapt this for any other framework.

### Why Vitest?

It's faster than Jest, and a better fit for unit tests than Playwright.

### Why Playwright?

It allows for component/integration-level tests in your plugin.

### Why pnpm?

It's faster than npm & yarn and more stable than bun.
